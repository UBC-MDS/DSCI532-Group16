# Reflection

For this milestone, our group has successfully implemented a working skeleton of our proposed dashboard.

We have a map visualization that displays the count of mental health conditions by each state in the US (We decided to work with only US data for this project, since it made up the majority of the dataset and for ease of integration with the map visualization).

We have 2 other charts at the moment, that bring to life 2 questions that were asked in the survey. There are 4 different filtering options in the form of a drop down, a slider, and 2 checkbox filters for multiple selection. All 4 filters are used as callbacks for the 2 charts. The age, gender and self-employed filters are also used as callbacks for the map.

For future milestones, we aim to implement the following improvements to the dashboard:

-   Aesthetic changes to make the dashboard more visually pleasing, including improved layout and themes for the charts and filters.

-   Addition of a few more meaningful charts of different types to bring to life more analysis from the data.

-   Update the drop down to be a multi-selection dropdown.

-   2 way integration between map and some charts, ie when states are selected from the map, the chart use those selections as a filter.
