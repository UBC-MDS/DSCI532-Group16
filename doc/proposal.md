# Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science consultancy firm

Target audience: HR department of tech companies

Employee turnover due to poor mental health costs companies a lot of money every year in rehiring and training, and also affects the reputation of the company's work culture. If we could understand factors that lead to poor employee mental health, it may be possible to help employees and improve the work place environment, thereby reducing employee turnover and improving productivity. To address this, we propose building a data visualization app that allows HR departments to visually explore a dataset that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in various tech companies. The app will showcase frequency of mental health disorders by geography and allow users to explore different aspects by filtering on variables such as age, gender and other categorical variables related to attitudes towards mental health in companies.
