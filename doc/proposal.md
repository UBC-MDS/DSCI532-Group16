# Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science consultancy firm

Target audience: HR department of tech companies

Employee turnover due to poor mental health costs companies a lot of money every year in rehiring and training, and also affects the reputation of the company's work culture. If we could understand factors that lead to poor employee mental health, it may be possible to help employees and improve the work place environment, thereby reducing employee turnover and improving productivity. To address this, we propose building a data visualization app that allows HR departments to visually explore a dataset that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in various tech companies. The app will showcase frequency of mental health disorders by geography and allow users to explore different aspects by filtering on variables such as age, gender and other categorical variables related to attitudes towards mental health in companies.

## Description of the data

We will be visualizing a dataset of 1259 employee mental health surveys in companies across 48 countries from a survey completed in 2014. Each survey describes:

- the employee (age, gender, country and state they live in), 
- employee mental illness history (family_history, treatment and work_interfere)
- employment status (self_employed and remote_work), 
- company information (no_employees and tech_company), 
- company healthcare (benefits, care_options, wellness_programs, seek_help, anonymity, leave, mentalhealthconsequence, physhealthconsequence, mentalvsphysical and obs_consequence), and
- privacy (coworkers, supervisor, mentalhealthinterview and physhealthinterview)

## Research questions and usage scenarios
Â 
John is a Human Resources Director for an international technology company and wants to understand the attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech industry. This will help him make decisions to increase company satisfaction among employees and attract better talent by improving mental health benefits and resources in the company. He wants to be able to [explore] a dataset and [identify] attitudes and frequency of mental health illness in different geographic locations and among different demographic variables. 

When John uses this dashboard he will be able to see the variables in this dataset such as age, gender and geographic location and be able to filter it to best suit his needs depending on the offices or groups he is focused on. When he filters by geographic location and age he may notice that older workers in European countries have less knowledge of company provided resources for mental health compared to their North American counterparts. As this dataset is in regards to the tech industry itself and not his company John could conduct an internal study to see if this is also the case in his offices. Or, among other possibilities, he could come up with a strategy to help make known these resources to those employees in his European offices. Regardless of what John chooses to do, this dashboard will help aid him in improving mental health among workers in the company.
